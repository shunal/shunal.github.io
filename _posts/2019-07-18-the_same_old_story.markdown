Hi my name is Steven Hunal. I am currently a student enrolled in Flatirons Software Engineering Program. I have been interested in tech for as long as I can remember. From the first time I picked up a video game controller and saved Princess Peach from Bowser I was hooked. I soon found myself surrounded by friends who I would play video games with constantly. 

I always admired games because it gave people such an easy way to not only compete against eachother but also as a medium to come together


The ability to program is really the ability to create and depending on what you create, that creation has the ability to do some really incredible things and it is for that reason why I have always wanted to learn how to be a Software Engineer.
